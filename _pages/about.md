I'm a Data Science student at the University of California, San Diego, interested in industry roles focused on data analysis, experimentation, and decision-making.

My work emphasizes understanding real-world datasets that are messy, incomplete, and noisy. I focus on asking clear questions, validating assumptions, and using exploratory analysis and metric evaluation to uncover patterns that meaningfully explain outcomes.

I am particularly interested in problems involving:
- Measuring the impact of decisions or interventions
- Understanding temporal and behavioral patterns in data
- Translating technical findings into clear, actionable insights

Through my projects, I have worked with large tabular datasets, time-series data, and unstructured text. I enjoy bridging data engineering, analysis, and communication to drive informed decision-making.

I am currently seeking data science or analytics roles where data is used to inform strategy, evaluate performance, and support product or business decisions.
