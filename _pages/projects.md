## Causal NLP Knowledge Graph Extraction
*2025*  
- Developed a pipeline to extract knowledge and causal relationships from textual data using neural extraction (OneKE) and knowledge graphs.  
- Constructed and stored extracted triples in Neo4j, with export to CSV for causal analysis.  
- Prepared for integration with causal discovery tools to explore directional relationships in extracted knowledge.  
- **Tools:** Python, Neo4j, Docker  
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jessicabat/causal-nlp-extraction)

## Mouse Circadian Rhythm Analysis
*2025*  
- Analyzed minute-level activity and core body temperature data over two weeks.  
- Investigated sex-based differences and estrus-related temporal patterns under controlled light cycles.  
- Focused on time-series analysis and visualization.  
- **Tools:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter  

## League of Legends Objective Impact Analysis
*2024*  
- Explored professional *League of Legends* match data to analyze the impact of securing the Rift Herald on team performance and match outcomes.  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on gold, experience, kills, and objective control using large-scale competitive match data.  
- Discovered that early objective control correlates with higher mid-game gold/XP advantages and increased win likelihood.  
- **Tools:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, Jupyter
