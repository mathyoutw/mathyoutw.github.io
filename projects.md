## Causal NLP Knowledge Graph Extraction
- Built a pipeline to extract knowledge and causal relationships from textual data using neural extraction (OneKE) and knowledge graphs
- Constructed and stored extracted triples in Neo4j, exported to CSV for causal analysis
- Set up for integration with causal discovery tools to explore directional relationships in extracted knowledge
- Python, Neo4j, OneKE, Docker
